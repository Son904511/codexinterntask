#### üîß Features:
- Multiple pages (Home, About, Contact)
- Navigation bar with active link highlighting

## üìÇ Repository Structure
Each project is structured as an individual React app with its own dependencies and can be run independently.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/codexintern-projects.git
   cd codexinterntask

   cd translator-app       # or random-string-app / codexintern-routing
   npm install
   npm start               # or npm run dev if using Vite

## üìö Learning Outcomes

Through the completion of these projects, I enhanced my understanding of:

- Integrating third-party APIs using Axios and managing keys securely with `.env` files
- Using modern React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`) effectively
- Implementing responsive UI components using Tailwind CSS
- Setting up client-side routing using `react-router-dom` for single-page applications

These projects reflect practical applications of core React concepts in real-world scenarios.
